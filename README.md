# ACARS Aircraft Profiles
## Overview
This repository contains a collection of custom aircraft profiles which can be used (amongst other things) to prevent being marked down for features that your aircraft don't have (e.g. Beacon lights).

## How to Use
Download the required profiles and save them into the "aircraft_custom" folder of your ACARS installation

If you wish the profiles to apply to a specific airline, create a folder with the airline profile name inside "aircraft_custom" and then copy the aircraft profiles into that folder.

You can also download the latest release of all profiles which will be created on adhoc basis
